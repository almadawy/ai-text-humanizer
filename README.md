# AI Text Humanizer

A React application that helps make AI-generated text sound more naturally human by applying various linguistic transformations.

## Features

- **Text Obfuscation**: Transforms AI-generated text to make it less detectable
- **Real-time Processing**: Scans and modifies text instantly
- **One-click Copy**: Easily copy the humanized output
- **Conversational Style**: Adds natural imperfections and casual language

## How It Works

The app applies several transformation techniques:
- Adds occasional hesitation markers (..., hmm, well, actually)
- Varies punctuation for more natural flow
- Replaces formal words with casual alternatives
- Uses contractions where natural
- Adds conversational fillers and intensifiers
